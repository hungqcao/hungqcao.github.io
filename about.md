I am from Ha Long, Quang Ninh, Vietnam - a must-visit place when you travel to Vietnam, a place filming King Kong (2016). I have been living in US since 2015. Traveling is my favorite activity. I used to learn playing guitar myself for a while. Hmm, what else, I also played some competitive Dota 1, and now I play Dota2 (Valve) few times a month with my friend ^^.
